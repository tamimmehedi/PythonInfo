It's very important to mention that- choose those books which have lots of exercises to practise. This is the most
important part to look for a Python book. The second most important thing is to stick to a book for a while. Many
people just change books in every while which is a cause of destruction and ending up with no knowledge. 

*The first on line book I can strongly recommend is an interactive book. You can get it for free. 
    The book link is : http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/index.html.

*As normal books, I always love O'Relly Books.They are very easy for a beginner.
