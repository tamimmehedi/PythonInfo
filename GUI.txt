Short for Graphical User Interface, a GUI (pronounced as either G-U-I or gooey) allows 
the use of icons or other visual indicators to interact with electronic devices, rather
than using only text via the command line. For example, all versions of Microsoft Windows
utilize a GUI, whereas MS-DOS does not. Python is a good programming language for GUI.
