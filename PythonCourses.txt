There are tons of platforms to learn Python:

*Udemy is my most favourite learning platform as it is reasonable. Besides you have options to select from a number of courses. 
Most of the courses offer you a 30 days money back Warranty. 

*Treehouse is also a good platform to learn. I stopped there as it was expensive for me. 

*Learning from Youtube- I would definitely not recommend. Those are too basic and won't help you in your professional career. 

But whichever you choose just remember to choose the courses where you can learn by working,creating. This is the 
best way to learn because just following a theoretical course would never help you to gain professional Knowledge.
